[h1][b]Welcome to Peace Treaties Expanded Anbennar[/b][/h1]
This mod adds some peace treaties and Casus Bellis from "Peace Treaties Expanded" adjusted to fit with Anbennar.

Hegemony and slavery abolishment is not tested because it requires lategame.

[h1]Currently Added[/h1]
Currently [i]Peace Treaties Expanded Anbennar[/i] adds the following peace options. Some require a special CB or have minor requirements to show up in the peace treaty window (e.g. require a specific army size).
Additional information about each treaty as well as the added Casus Bellis can be found [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/2615504872/2961670721745264890/]here[/url].

[list]
[*] Force Seppuku - todo target because I don't know who in Anbennar may commit Seppuku

[*] Liberate the Holy See - Ravelian doesn't have capital
[*] Sacrifice Ruler - todo target because I don't know much about countries from Anbennar which uses DOOM
